# Become an Ethereum 2.0 Validator*

_* Testnet validator_

If you're familiar with using the terminal of your operating system, becoming a
Lighthouse validator is easy. All you need is your terminal and this website.

### 1. Download and install Lighthouse

If you already have Rust installed, you can install Lighthouse with the
following three commands:

- `$ git clone https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse.git`
- `$ cd lighthouse`
- `$ make`

If you're not familiar with Rust or you'd like more detailed instructions, see
the [Installation Guide](./installation.md).

The [Docker Guide](./docker.md) is great if you have Docker installed and would
like to avoid installing Rust.

### 2. Start your Beacon Node

The beacon node is the core component of Eth2, it connects to other peers over
the Internet and maintains a view of the chain.

Start your beacon node with:

```bash
$ lighthouse beacon --eth1
```

> The `--eth1` flag tells the beacon node that it should sync with an Ethereum
> 1 node (e.g., Geth). This is only required if you wish to run a validator.

### 3. Generate your validator key

Generate your validator keys using:

```shell
$ lighthouse account validator new random
```

> This will generate a new _validator directory_ in the `.lighthouse/validators`
> directory. Your validator directory will be identified by it's public key,
> which looks something like `0xc483de...`. You'll need to find this directory
> for the next step.


<div class="form-signin" id="uploadDiv">
	<h3 class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal">4. Submit your deposit</h1>
	<p>Upload the <code>eth1_deposit_data.rlp</code> file from your validator
	directory and we'll submit a 3.2 Goerli-ETH deposit using Metamask.</p>
	<input id="fileInput" type="file" style="display: none">
	<button id="uploadButton" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary btn-block"
							  type="submit">Upload and Submit Deposit</button>
</div>

<div class="form-signin" id="waitingDiv" style="display: none">
	<h3 class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal">Deposit Transaction Sent</h1>
	<p>Your validator deposit was submitted!</p>
	<p>See the transaction on <a id="txLink" target="_blank"
											 href="https://etherscan.io">Etherscan</a>
	or <a href="">reload</a> to perform another deposit.</p>
</div>

<div class="form-signin" id="errorDiv" style="display: none">
	<h3 class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal">Error</h1>
	<p id="errorText">Unknown error.</p>
</div>

> This deposit is using gETH (Goerli ETH) which has no real value. Don't ever
> send _real_ ETH to our deposit contract!

### 5. Start your validator client

For security reasons, the validator client runs separately to the beacon node.
It's job is to store keys and sign blocks and attestations generated by the
beacon node.

Start the validator client with:

```
$ lighthouse validator
```
